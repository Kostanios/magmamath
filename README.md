# üöÄ User Notification Microservices

This project consists of two microservices: `user` and `notification`, communicating over RabbitMQ.  
The **User Service** handles basic CRUD operations for users, while the **Notification Service** listens for user-related events and processes notifications accordingly.

---

## üê≥ Getting Started (via Docker)

To run the entire application stack, simply run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Make sure Docker is installed and running on your system.

This will spin up the following services:

User Service (http://localhost:3000)

Notification Service (http://localhost:3001)

MongoDB (for user data persistence)

RabbitMQ (http://localhost:15672, default login: guest/guest)
